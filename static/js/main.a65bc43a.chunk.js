I'll also be giving out official merch (probably new album + official posters) but I may do it like the 5th person to come gets an album, since they will be limited. Lemme know if your interested in that so I can get a good estimate of how much stuff I shud get. (Pics are example of the photocards), UPDATE: So change of plans I will be giving out 50 goodie bags each concert (LA Day 1&2 and NJ Day 1&2)along with those 50 goodie bags I am going to give away 4 bts albums (the persona ones with no photocard cus I'm a hoe and am gonna keep it) but it will be 1 album per concert day. Along with all that I will be giving out random bts official posters that I believe deserve a good home. And possibly 2 other suprises (ly tour merch or sy tour merch or something extra special depending on things). I will update what I'm giving away on a new post the day of each concert and where to find me. U can follow me on twt: @Kaypoppin_unnie or on insta: @da_bro_nation or just look for my post in the LA Group and Metlife group the day of each concert.
